Q-Article Audio, the Chrome extension, includes manfiest v3(actually for now it is manifest v2 because the web-ext module on npm is only compatible with mv2, but it also makes development much easier.) and UI components from the material design library <a href="https://svelte-materialify.vercel.app/" title="Svelte Materialify">Svelte Materialify</a>. This chrome extension is coded with

Note: <b>Unreleased on any web extension stores</b>
Feel free to try it out:

In your terminal(i use bash) :
 `git clone y330/q-article-audio`

then `cd q-article-audio`.

after this:
`pnpm i` Instead you can also use `NPM`,`yarn`, or another suitable package manager of your choice, but its my personal preference to use `pnpm`.

After installing dependancies with the previous command, type the following in your terminal:
`pnpm run dev`

then go to chrome://extensions and turn on developer mode, and press "load unpacked", and pick the dist directory in the q-article-audio folder. And your done!ü§ù
