<h6>Designed and Developed by Yonah Aviv</h6>



With Q-Article Audio, <b>listen to the rest of an article</b> as a podcast within the extension popup or on your smartphone using a QR code.

<h4>Video Demo: <a href="#" title="demo"><em>Coming soon</em></a></h4>

-------


Q-Article Audio, the Chrome extension, includes manfiest v3(actually for now it is manifest v2 because the web-ext module on npm is only compatible with mv2, but it also makes development much easier.) and UI components from the material design library <a href="https://svelte-materialify.vercel.app/" title="Svelte Materialify">Svelte Materialify</a>. This chrome extension is coded with
- <a href="https://svelte.dev/" title="Svelte website">__Svelte__</a>
- <a href="https://rollupjs.org" title="webpack.js website">Rollup</a>

__Here are screenshots of a semi-functional version 0.2.0__(Using Material Design)
p.s. I actually like windows better; its just the OS X window frames look better.

## Local Development

Feel free to my extension it out:

In your preferred terminal(I use bash) type the following:

1. `git clone y330/q-article-audio`
That clones the repo into a new folder called _q-article-audio/_

2. `cd q-article-audio`.
That enters into the scope of _q-article-audio/_

3. `pnpm i`
That installs the dependencies using pnpm([performant]npm). Feel free to use yarn or npm alternatively.


After installing dependencies with the previous command, type the following in your terminal to run a local server for development of the extension[no hmr :(]


4. `pnpm run dev`

5. Go  to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
6. Then, do the following:
   a. Turn on developer mode
   
   b. Click on _load unpacked_. This will open a file explorer window.
   
   c. Navigate to _q-article-audio/_ , and choose the _dist/_ directory.
    


And your done!ü§ù
